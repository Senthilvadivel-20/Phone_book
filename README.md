## Inspiration
This was inspired from a common man's life ,about his experience of phone calling. 
## What it does
The application will help a user to predict if a person s/he is calling will pickup the call or not.

## How we built it
The application uses machine learning algorithm ,KNN-model , to acknowledge whether a person will pick up their call or not .


## Challenges we ran into
We had to collect the data from different individuals and then processed them. The rest went on smooth

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
we did make a good team in developing and designing the PhoneBooks and we are proud that it turned out well.

## What we learned
We are pretty much fascinated to know how the teamwork helped in executing a simple idea and made it a wonderful success.
## What's next for PhoneBooks
Well, PhoneBooks can be embedded with the regular phone calling apps to enhance user experience while calling someone.
